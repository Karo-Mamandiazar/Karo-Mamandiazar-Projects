# Dot and Outer Product Calculator

A Python program that computes dot and outer products of vectors using NumPy.

## Features

- Calculates dot product of two vectors
- Calculates outer product of two vectors
- Demonstrates essential vector operations

## How It Works

The program:
1. Creates two 3-dimensional vectors
2. Calculates the dot product
3. Calculates the outer product
4. Displays both results

## Vector Operations Explained

### Dot Product
##### The dot product (scalar product) multiplies corresponding elements and sums them:
```v1 · v2 = (1×4) + (2×5) + (3×6) = 4 + 10 + 18 = 32```
Result is a **single number** (scalar).

### Outer Product
##### The outer product multiplies each element of v1 with each element of v2:
```
v1 ⊗ v2 = [1,2,3]ᵀ × [4,5,6]
        = [[1×4, 1×5, 1×6],
           [2×4, 2×5, 2×6],
           [3×4, 3×5, 3×6]]
```

Result is a **matrix** (2D array).
