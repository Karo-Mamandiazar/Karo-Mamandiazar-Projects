# 📧 Email Spam Detection

A machine learning project to classify emails as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using multiple classifiers and ensemble learning techniques.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project builds and compares multiple machine learning models to detect spam emails. It uses **TF-IDF** vectorization for feature extraction and evaluates several classifiers including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest, and SVM. A **Stacking Classifier** is also implemented to combine the strengths of all models for improved performance.

## 📈️ How It Works

* Data Preprocessing: Clean the email text (remove special characters, stopwords, etc.)
* 
* Feature Extraction: Convert text to numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorizer

* Model Training: Train multiple classifiers on the training data

* Ensemble Learning: Combine models using Stacking Classifier with SVM as meta-learner
* 
* Evaluation: Compare all models using classification metrics

## 📊️ Dataset
The dataset used is the SMS Spam Collection Dataset, containing:

* 5,574 SMS messages

* Labeled as spam or ham (not spam)
